\section{Introduction}
The purpose of the template is mainly to standardise the length of the report for the class. Please note that the section titles used here are not suggested for your report. You should rename and add/delete sections as you see fit.

Small deviations from the template will be forgiven. Just try to stick to it as close as you can.

MS Word and Latex versions of this template are provided. There may be small differences in the two templates.

\section{Description}
If you are not using Latex or Word, try to heed the following basic format description.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Text should be 10pt Helvetica and single spaced
    \item Headings should be between 10pt to 16pt. 
    \item A space of at least 6pt should be left after every paragraph or heading.
    \item Margins should be 1 inch on all four sides. 
    \item A small header should be included and must contain your Name and Student ID. You should also indicate the module code, module name, year and assignment number. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Citing third party resources}
It is important that you provide a reference to where you got your data. You must also cite any third party sources for elements you have included in your project or report. This includes code-snippets, libraries, tools. 

There is no need to cite the lecture notes.  Avoid repeatedly (more than once) citing commonly used references in the module such as Munzner's book \cite{munzner} unless you are directly quoting something.

A basic example of a bibliography is provided but you may alternatively use BibTex (for latex users), Endnote or any other bibliography manager.
